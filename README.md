# LL(1) Parser

This project implements an LL(1) parser in Python that analyzes a context-free grammar, computes its **First** and **Follow** sets, constructs the **LL(1) parsing table**, and checks whether the grammar is ambiguous or valid for LL(1) parsing.



## 🔍 Features

- Parses a grammar that is free from left recursion and left factoring.
- Computes First and Follow sets for all non-terminals.
- Constructs the LL(1) parsing table.
- Detects ambiguous or invalid LL(1) grammars.
- Includes working code and example grammars.



## 💻 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository or download the script.**

2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

3. Run the script using:
Python



## 📚 Educational Purpose
This project was developed as part of a university assignment in Compiler Design. It demonstrates key parsing techniques used in compilers and is intended for students learning about syntax analysis and grammar parsing.



## ✅ Objectives Met
